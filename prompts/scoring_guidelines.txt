SCORING GUIDELINES (per criterion, 1–10):
General anchors: 9–10 Outstanding; 7–8 Strong; 5–6 Fair; 3–4 Weak; 1–2 Poor.

Novelty / Market Need:
  9–10: World-first or category-creating with clear client impact.
  7–8: Industry-first in sector/region or step-change over status quo.
  5–6: TCS-first or materially ahead of current TCS/partner offerings.
  4:   Unit/BG-first; mostly incremental within a BU/context.
  1–3: Derivative; no meaningful gap identified.

Solution Clarity & Targeting:
  9/10: Clearly articulated; unambiguous scope & personas; strong narrative.
  7/8:  Clear but can be refined (minor ambiguities).
  5/6:  Satisfactory; key elements present but uneven.
  3/4:  Unclear/contradictory; material gaps.
  1/2:  Incoherent or missing fundamentals.

Implementation Feasibility:
  9–10: Architecture, data flows, dependencies explicit; risks mitigated; realistic resourcing/timeline.
  7–8:  Solid plan with minor gaps; risks manageable.
  5–6:  Plausible but significant unknowns or missing milestones/owners.
  3–4:  High technical/integration risk; weak resourcing.
  1–2:  Unrealistic with current tech/constraints.

Long-Term Value & Sustenance:
  9–10: Strong economics & defensibility (IP/data/network); clear GTM; scalable; trend-aligned.
  7–8:  Good path to scale with a few open questions.
  5–6:  Some value but uncertain durability/expansion path.
  3–4:  Narrow/one-off; limited reuse; weak economics.
  1–2:  Low or negative long-term value.

Security & Compliance:
  9–10: Privacy-by-design; concrete controls (IAM, least privilege, KMS, logging, DLP); regs mapped; AI misuse safeguards.
  7–8:  Most controls addressed with minor gaps.
  5–6:  Partial coverage; risks noted but not mitigated.
  3–4:  Material gaps (residency/retention/access).
  1–2:  Non-compliant or high-risk by design.

Evidence & Documentation:
  9–10: Compelling evidence (prototype) and thorough docs.
  7–8:  wireframes.
  5–6:  Light evidence (more documentation).
  1–4:  Poor documentation or No evidence or documentation.
