EXPERT EVALUATION CRITERIA & QUESTIONS (weights in parentheses):
1) NOVELTY (15%)
   - Problem significance; differentiation vs alternatives; market gap; category creation/disruption.
2) CLARITY (20%)
   - What/how/for whom; personas & buyers; value prop; differentiators; domain understanding.
3) FEASIBILITY (20%)
   - Technical approach credibility; integration complexity; resources & timeline; risks & mitigations; regulatory constraints.
4) LONG_TERM_VALUE (20%)
   - Business model; GTM; scalability; defensibility/switching costs; TAM expansion; enterprise trend alignment.
5) SECURITY_COMPLIANCE (15%)
   - Data handling (PII/PHI); authN/authZ; encryption (in transit/at rest); key mgmt; audit logging; AI misuse safeguards; regulatory mapping (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, SOC 2).
6) EVIDENCE (10%)
   - PoC/demo; benchmarks/metrics; user feedback; references; professional completeness.

RESPONSE FORMAT & RULES
- Return ONLY a JSON object conforming to the provided schema (no markdown/code fences).
- For each criterion, include: score (1–10), a 2–4 sentence justification, and insufficient_info (true/false).
- Compute weighted_total using: WT = 0.15*n + 0.20*c + 0.20*f + 0.20*l + 0.15*s + 0.10*e (scores 1–10). Round to one decimal (half-up).
- investment_recommendation: one of [go, consider-with-mitigations, no-go].
- Provide 2–3 key_strengths and 2–3 key_concerns (short, specific).
- Optionally add up to 3 assumptions and any relevant flags [compliance_risk, novelty_unclear, integration_complexity, data_gaps, ethical_risk].
- Set schema_version = "tcs-ideathon.v2" and echo rubric_weights = {{"novelty": 0.15, "clarity": 0.20, "feasibility": 0.20, "long_term_value": 0.20, "security_compliance": 0.15, "evidence": 0.10}}.
