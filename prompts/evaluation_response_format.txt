YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A SINGLE JSON OBJECT.
The JSON object must have the following structure:
{
    "scores": {
        "novelty_and_innovation": {
            "score": <int, 1-10>,
            "justification": "<string>"
        },
        "business_potential_and_impact": {
            "score": <int, 1-10>,
            "justification": "<string>"
        },
        // ... other rubric criteria ...
    },
    "weighted_total": <float>,
    "investment_recommendation": "<string, one of: 'strong-yes', 'consider-with-mitigations', 'no-go'>",
    "key_strengths": ["<string>", ...],
    "key_concerns": ["<string>", ...]
}
Ensure all scores are integers between 1 and 10.
The "weighted_total" will be recalculated by the system, so focus on accurate individual scores.
